# DeribitTradingSystem :brain:

## Description :penguin:
An algorithmic trading system designed using a Python server and a React.js front-end which trades on the crypto-currency exchange Deribit. This system is not able to work as of now since Deribit does not allow US residents to trade on their exchange. Overall this was a fun project for me having been able to create a powerful asynchronus server which imports high speed websocket data, along with using sockets to send trade orders. The front end has a graphical interface showing live updates to the orderbook, along with showcasing metrics such as filled order volume on the home page. As I said before, this system does not work anymore, however, if you would like to add modifications to this system, feel free. I would like to see this project go far.

## Running Example :ice_cube:
```shell
python server & npm start
```
